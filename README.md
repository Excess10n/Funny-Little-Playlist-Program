# Top-ranked-beat-saber-playlist
Random app made in python that I made to mess around with api's (specifically the scoresaber api)

It essentially looks at the top ranked maps of the userID given, and creates a bplist file of this data in the given directory

Will send more than one request if the user inputs more than 100 maps, so it won't return a bad request (response 400)

don't ask for more maps than your ranked plays (it will return a bad response (400))

# Other-Updates
Make for beat leader

Other playlists (don't know what they will be yet)
