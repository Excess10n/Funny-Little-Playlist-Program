# Top-ranked-beat-saber-playlist
Random app made in python that I made to mess around with api's (specifically the scoresaber api).
It essentially looks at the top ranked maps of the userID given, and creates a JSON file of this data in the given directory (not a bplist file (cry about it)).

Will be updated later to create a user data file instead of it needing to be downloaded with the exe

Also, don't ask for more than 100 songs to be in the playlist otherwise umbra will hunt you down
